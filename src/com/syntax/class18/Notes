What are constructors in Java?
    A constructor is a special block of code that helps us give initial values to the
    fields of a class, initialization of object or instance.

Why we should use a constructor:
    1) When we use a constructor to initialize the object,
        its more readable and looks cleaner
    2) If the fields of a class are private, its not possible to
        access them outside of a class without constructor or a method
        which means we can't initialize them without a method or a constructor.
    3) We can enforce rules like what kind of values are assigned to variables
        with the help of a constructor.
    4) If we want to make sure that some lines of code should always be executed
        when the object of a class is created, we can put that code inside the constructor.

How to use constructor:
    We create constructors inside the class and when an object of that class
    is created the constructor is executed automatically.

class Car{
String make;
String model;

Car(String carMake, String carModel) {
make = carMake;
model=carModel;
}

public static void main (String[] args) {
Car bmw = new Car ("BMW", "m4");
}
}

RULES:
    1) Constructors don't have return types... not even void.
    2) The name of the constructor should always be same as name of the class
    3) Constructors can't be created with a static keyword.
    4) We can use any access modifiers with Constructors
    5) If we don't create a constructor in a class, a default constructor with
        zero parameters is created by compiler. (Takes the code written by us and it
THIS KEYWORD:
    We can use "this." keyword to access the instance variables when you have same name variables and your method
    or constructor or any block of code.

this():
    calls the constructor of a class inside other constructor.
    why we use it --> it help us reuse already written constructors contains same code
    why we want to create multiple constructor in the first place--> we want to give end user flexibility that he
    can create the objects of our class in may different ways
