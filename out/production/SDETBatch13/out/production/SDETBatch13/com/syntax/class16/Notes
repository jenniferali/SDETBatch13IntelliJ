NOTES:

There are 3 types of variables in Java: local, instance, static

LOCAL VARIABLE:
    Are the variables which are created INSIDE a block of code like method, loop,
    switch, if else, or a constructor.

Advantages:
    Local variables are always preferable to instance or static variables.
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. Always try to
    use local variables when possible to save memory.

Disadvantages:
    Limited scope. They can't be accessed outside of method or that block of
    code in which they are created.
Class Countries{
void USA()
String person="ElisaBro";
}
void Russia() {
System.out.println(person) // Will create an error because "person" is only
accessible in the USA method.
}
}

INSTANCE VARIABLES:
    They are created INSIDE the class, but outside a block of code.

Advantages:
    Instance variables are accessible everywhere in a class, in all blocks of code.
    But not in a static variable!

Disadvantages:
    They occupy memory for longer periods of time.

STATIC VARIABLES:
    The "static" keyword will pair with an instance variable and become a static one.

Advantages:
    They have the highest scope available, even outside of an object.
    If we know that a value will stay the same for all objects of a class,
    go with static variable to save memory.

Disadvantages:
    They occupy memory for the longest period of time.
    They can hold only a single value for all the objects.
