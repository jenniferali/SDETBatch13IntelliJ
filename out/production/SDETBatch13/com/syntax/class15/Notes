How to change theme:
    double click on the shift button twice inside the pop up type theme and hit enter.
    After that you will see the options to change the theme.
What is a method:
    Method in java is block of code(group of java statements). It defines the behaviour
    of a class.

Why we should use methods:
    1) it helps us remove the duplicate code from our application. We just create a method and
    every time we need that logic we just call the method that contains the logic.
    2) It also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes the development of
    large applications easier.

How to use Methods:
    1) First we create the method inside a class.
    2) We create the object of that class
    3) we call the method by writing the name of the object a dot name of the method

class Calculator{

void add(int x,int y){
System.out.println(x+y);
}

public static void main(String [] args){
Calculator calculator=new Calculator();
calculator.add(10,20);
}

}
Rules to create and use methods:
void add(int x,int y){
System.out.println(x+y);
}
void=> void is a return type and it is a must if you want to return a specific data write the name
    of that data type like for int  we write int for String
    we write String and if we don't want to return anything we write void
    when we write a void we can't assign a method call to a variable
add=>    next we write the name of the method which can be anything it should follow
    the rules for giving a name to a variable
()=>  We specify the parameters here we can pass any data type inside theese
     parenthesis
     They are optional we can leave them empty

 {
 System.out.println(x+y);
 }
 The Body of the method that contains the java statements

  add(int x,int y) => This part with the name of the method and its parameters is
  called signature of a method
void add(int x,int y) header of the method

Types of Variables in Java:
There are three type variables in java: 1) Local    2) Instance     3)Static
1. Local variable:
 if a variable is inside a method or a part of its parameters or a loop
or switch statement it is called a local variable.
2. Instance variable:
 if a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.
3. Static Variables:
 if an instance variable has a static keyword with it than it is called static variable.

  WHY LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF VARIABLES?
1.IT HELPS US REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF "RAM"THAT OUR APPLICATIONS WILL BE USING WHEN IT WILL BE RUNNING.

2. WITH THE HELP OF THESE VARIABLES WE CAN PASS THE INFORMATION BETWEEN METHODS OF CLASS.

3.LOCAL VARIABLES OCCUPY THE MEMORY OR THE SHORTEST PERIOD OF TIME AS SOON AS YOUR METHOD
IS DONE EXECUTING THEY ARE DESTROYED BY A SPECIAL PROGRAM CALLED GARBAGE COLLECTOR.

 HOW TO USE THESE VARIABLES?
Local : create inside block of code

Advantages vs Disadvantages
LOCAL VARIABLES:
Advantages:
    They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time,
    so always try to use local variables when possible
Disadvantages:
    They are very limited in scope, which means we can't access them outside of method or that block of code.

INSTANCE VARIABLES:
Advantages:
    They have broader scope as compared to local variables which means we can access them in all the
    methods of that class.
Disadvantages:
    They occupy the space in your RAM for longer periods of time.

STATIC VARIABLES:
Advantages:
    We can call static variables without creating an object of a class.
    We can share a single value between all the objects of a class.
