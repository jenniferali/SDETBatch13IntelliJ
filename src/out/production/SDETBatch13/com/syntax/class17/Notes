ACCESS MODIFIERS:
    Access modifiers are keywords in Java that help us control the access
    of classes, variables and methods and other blocks of code.

    There are 4 access levels in Java:
    1.Private   2.Default (not a keyword)   3.Protected   4.Public

    Three keywords that define these access levels:
    1. Private  2.Protected   3.Public

PRIVATE:
    When the private keyword is used with a method or field, its only
    accessible INSIDE that CLASS. The most restricted access modifier.

DEFAULT (not a keyword):
    When no access modifier keyword is used with a field or method then
    default access is applied by Java. This means we can access variable or method
    INSIDE the same CLASS and other classes INSIDE the PACKAGE.

PROTECTED:
    With a protected access modifier we can access that method or variable
    INSIDE the same CLASS+INSIDE the OTHER CLASSES in the PACKAGE
    +classes INSIDE DIFFERENT PACKAGES, as well, but they must have a "extends relationship"
    with the original class.

PUBLIC:
    When we use the public access modifier we can use that field or method ANYWHERE INSIDE
    the SAME PROJECT. We can access them in the class + in the package + in other packages + in the project.
